Imran Marwat - Game of Life

GOL_Class.py is a class containing the methods to simulate the Game of Life by John Horton Conway. GOL_Script.py is the script to run the simulation.

Rules for the Game of Life are included in comments but for more information see the following link "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"

At present, methods for the following structures exist: absorbing state, blinker, glider and a completely random lattice.

To run, User should enter: GOL_Script.py <dimension of lattice> <structure> <task>

The following tasks are defined in the script:(1) <task> = "viz". Simple animation of GOL with user defined initial structure, (2) <task> = "data". If user selects a Glider, tracks the position of the centre of mass of glider and displays in a graph. Also calculates the constant velocity of the glider.
